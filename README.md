# Web
Attended a 5 sessions long web development workshop taught by university top academia where we learnt the basics of web developing using HTML, CSS and JavaScipt.

We culminated by designing our own Google Chrome Dinosaur Run like game. Decided to give it a fun kick and make it children appropiate by employing the cartoon myth that elephants are scared by mice.
